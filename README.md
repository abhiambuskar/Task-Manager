# Task-Manager
This is a personal project that in I have made which is use of task assignment purpose, I have made this site using MERN stack in which their are 2 user.

The first user is an employee an Employee is able to login and can add, update and delete thier tasks which what to do . They can also send the feedbacks to the admin about what changes can be done in the site to become it more efficient.

The second user is an Admin is also able to do login and can add, update and delete his tasks but he can also see the list of employees who are working under him and who are the other admins their and he able to see thier task list and can perform various filters on the tasks and can have a pictorial presentation.The admin is also able to see the feedbacks from their employees about their views on the site

The difference between both the users is done at the login pager where in the type section an employee has to write employee and admin has to write admin as thier type for admin an extra field will be generated which will be a secret key will only be known to admin and after writing it correctly he can login in admin type otherwise it will give them an error.
